            <h2>Our Policy</h2>
            <p>Welcome to BerlineBot!</p>
            <p>Eunit Designs, Inc. (“<strong>BerlineBot</strong>”, “<strong>Berline</strong>”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”) operates the web site www.berlinebot.github.io (the “<strong>Site</strong>”), and other related services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Eunit Designs’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“<strong>Personal Data</strong>”) and other information that is collected from users of the Services and/or visitors to the Site.</p>
            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>When you interact with us through the Services, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Services</strong>: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys (if you take part in any), or use certain Services. In addition, if you provide us with any chat logs (suggestions) to help feed our chatbot engine, those chat logs may contain your Personal Data. Wherever we collect Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p><strong>By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of ours and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</strong></p>
            <h2>Other Information</h2>
            <p><strong>Non-Identifiable Data</strong>: When you interact with us through the Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. We may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by our affiliates, agents or service providers. The Services may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process.</p>
            <p>In operating the Services, we may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Services gives to your browser when you access the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more accurately. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a “help” section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service features.</p>
            <p><strong>Third Party Tracking</strong>: We may allow third party service providers to use cookies or similar technologies to collect information about your browsing activities over time and across different websites following your use of the Services. For example, we use Google Analytics, an online analytics service operated by Google LLC (Google Analytics). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze traffic on the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Services. For more information on how Google LLC uses this data, go to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank" title="Google's Privacy Policy">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>
            <h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information</h2>
            <p>We use the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. We and our subsidiaries and affiliates (the “Related Companies”) may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the Services, to better understand our users and to improve the Services. We and our affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to “opt-out” of receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.</p>
            <p>If we intend on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.</p>

            <p>We are not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you. These are set forth below:</p>
            <!-- <p><strong>Business Transfers</strong>: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</p>
        <p><strong>Related Companies</strong>: We may also share your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties</strong>: We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p> -->
            <p><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the our rights or property, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.</p>

All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution.</p>
            <h2>Children</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Services.
